# FontAdapter: Tuning-Free Font Customization Framework

_FontAdapter_ is a framework designed for seamless font customization in text-to-image (T2I) generation. Unlike traditional approaches requiring fine-tuning, FontAdapter enables tuning-free font adaptation by leveraging synthetic datasets and a two-stage training scheme. The framework effectively integrates font styles into diverse visual contexts while maintaining high visual quality and text accuracy.

## Problem Statement

Our goal is to generate a visual text image with a _customized font style_, given a text prompt and a _font reference image_.

## What FontAdapter can do?

1. **Font Customization**: Adapt a wide range of font styles to T2I generation tasks without requiring additional fine-tuning.
2. **Visual Text Editing**: Enable controlled modifications to text content or font style in visual text images.
3. **Font Blending**: Interpolate between font styles to create new and unique designs.
4. **Cross-Lingual Adaptation**: Transfer font styles across different languages.

FontAdapter expands the boundaries of visual text generation, offering flexibility and precision across multiple use cases.
